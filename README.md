# ninaAPI

API for the astronomy imaging software N.I.N.A.
The documentation for the api can be found [here](https://bump.sh/christian-photo/doc/advanced-api), and the documentation for the websockets is available [here](https://bump.sh/christian-photo/doc/advanced-api-websockets).

This plugin aims to be an all-around api for building your own custom tools and apps! Let me know about any cool projects you make, at the bottom of the readme you can find a list containing cool projects using the api!

Many thanks to tcpalmer and his [web session plugin](https://github.com/tcpalmer/nina.plugin.web/tree/main), from which I took a lot of inspiration (and a few code snippets). I want to thank everyone for creating issues, reporting bugs to me and requesting new features! It really helps me a lot while trying to continually improve the api. All that to say, feature requests, bug reports and all of these things are highly welcome!
